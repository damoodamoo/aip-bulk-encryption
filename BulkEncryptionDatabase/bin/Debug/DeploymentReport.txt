     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[Files].[FileServer] is being dropped, data loss could occur.
       The column [dbo].[ServersFileServers].[FileServer] is being dropped, data loss could occur.
       The column [dbo].[ServersFileServers].[FileServerId] on table [dbo].[ServersFileServers] must be added, but the column
         has no default value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To
         avoid this issue you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the
         generation of smart-defaults as a deployment option.
